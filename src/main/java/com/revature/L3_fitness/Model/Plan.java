/**
 * The @Entity annotation informs Spring Data to map this object to a database table as part of a paradigm known as
 * 'object-relational-mapping'. By default, the Table and Column names should match the Class and Field names, but this
 * can be overridden. That means that Spring Data can use an existing 'Plan' table to automatically persist
 * this object as a database record, and it can retrieve 'Plan' objects from the 'Plan' table. Spring Data can
 * even create and modify tables for you, although this would not likely be done on real projects. See the
 * application.properties file in the resources folder for more info. Spring ORM Entities leverage the Hibernate
 * framework - you may see Hibernate when reading Stack traces or researching documentation.
 *
 * For the purpose of completing any challenges within this project: do not change anything within this class!
 * It is already complete.

     *
     * The @JsonBackReference annotation prevents this field from being part of the Object's JSON. This prevents the
     * field from resulting in an infinite JSON (eg a painting's artist's painting's artist...) You can swap
     * Painting's JsonBackReference with Artist's JsonManagedEntity if you need the Artist to be in the Painting's JSON.
